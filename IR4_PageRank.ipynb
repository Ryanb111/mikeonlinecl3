    "### **Problem Statement: PageRank Algorithm**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Goal**: \n",
    "Implement the **PageRank algorithm**, which is used to rank the importance of web pages based on their link structure. The algorithm assigns a ranking to each page in a web graph, with the assumption that more important pages are linked to by other important pages.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Detailed Explanation of the Code**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Overview of PageRank Algorithm**\n",
    "PageRank is based on the idea that a page is important if it is linked to by other important pages. The process involves:\n",
    "1. **Graph Representation**: The web is represented as a directed graph, where each page is a node, and a hyperlink is an edge from one node to another.\n",
    "2. **Initial Setup**: Each page starts with an equal rank.\n",
    "3. **Iterative Process**: In each iteration, the rank of each page is updated based on the ranks of the pages that link to it.\n",
    "4. **Convergence**: The process continues until the ranks stabilize (i.e., the changes are smaller than a given tolerance).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Explanation of the Code**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import numpy as np\n",
    "\n",
    "def pagerank(adj_matrix, damping_factor=0.85, max_iters=100, tol=1.0e-6):\n",

    "    Computes the PageRank for each page in a graph.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Parameters:\n",
    "    - adj_matrix: np.array, adjacency matrix where adj_matrix[i][j] means a link from j to i.\n",
    "    - damping_factor: float, probability of following a link (1 - damping_factor is the probability of teleporting).\n",
    "    - max_iters: int, the maximum number of iterations.\n",
    "    - tol: float, tolerance to decide when to stop iterations.\n",

    "```\n",
    "- **Parameters**:\n",
    "  - `adj_matrix`: The adjacency matrix represents the link structure of the web. If `adj_matrix[i][j] = 1`, it means there is a link from page `j` to page `i`. Otherwise, there is no link.\n",
    "  - `damping_factor`: This is the probability that a user will follow a link on a page, usually set to 0.85.\n",
    "  - `max_iters`: The maximum number of iterations the algorithm will run for.\n",
    "  - `tol`: Tolerance level to check if the ranks have converged (i.e., the change is less than this value).\n",

    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Step-by-Step Breakdown of the Code**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **1. Create a Stochastic Matrix**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "    n = adj_matrix.shape[0]\n",
    "    \n",
    "    # Create a stochastic matrix by dividing each column by the sum of the column\n",

    "```\n",
    "- **`n = adj_matrix.shape[0]`**: Get the number of pages (nodes) in the graph.\n",
    "- **`column_sums = np.sum(adj_matrix, axis=0)`**: Sum the elements in each column of the adjacency matrix. This gives the total number of outgoing links from each page.\n",
    "- **`stochastic_matrix = np.divide(adj_matrix, column_sums, where=column_sums != 0)`**: Normalize the adjacency matrix by dividing each column by its sum. This gives the transition probabilities for each link. If a column sum is zero (no outgoing links), we avoid division by zero using `where=column_sums != 0`.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **2. Initialize the PageRank Vector**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "    # Initialize PageRank vector with equal probability for each page\n",
    "    page_rank = np.ones(n) / n\n",
    "```\n",
    "- **Purpose**: Initialize the PageRank vector where each page has an equal rank to start with. Since there are `n` pages, each page gets a rank of `1/n`.\n",

    "#### **3. Iterative PageRank Calculation**\n",

    "        new_page_rank = ((1 - damping_factor) / n) + damping_factor * stochastic_matrix.dot(page_rank)\n",
    "        \n",
    "        # Check for convergence\n",
    "        if np.linalg.norm(new_page_rank - page_rank, 1) < tol:\n",
    "            break\n",
    "        page_rank = new_page_rank\n",
    "```\n",
    "- **`new_page_rank = ((1 - damping_factor) / n) + damping_factor * stochastic_matrix.dot(page_rank)`**:\n",
    "  - This is the core of the PageRank update formula. Each page's new rank is computed as a combination of:\n",
    "    1. The **teleportation factor** (`(1 - damping_factor) / n`), which gives an equal probability of jumping to any page.\n",
    "    2. The **link-following factor** (`damping_factor * stochastic_matrix.dot(page_rank)`), which updates the rank based on the ranks of the pages linking to it.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **`np.linalg.norm(new_page_rank - page_rank, 1) < tol`**:\n",
    "  - This checks the convergence of the algorithm. If the change in the rank vector is less than a certain tolerance (`tol`), the algorithm stops iterating.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`page_rank = new_page_rank`**:\n",
    "  - Update the PageRank vector with the newly computed ranks.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **4. Return the Final PageRank Vector**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "    return page_rank\n",

    "### **Example Adjacency Matrix**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "adj_matrix = np.array([[0, 0, 1, 1],\n",
    "                       [1, 0, 0, 0],\n",
    "                       [1, 1, 0, 1],\n",
    "                       [0, 1, 0, 0]])\n",
    "```\n",
    "This adjacency matrix represents the following link structure:\n",

    "- **Page 2** links to **Page 1**.\n",

    "page_rank = pagerank(adj_matrix)\n",
    "print(\"PageRank:\", page_rank)\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example:\n",
    "- **Page 1** and **Page 3** have higher importance (PageRank values of 0.327), meaning they have more influential links.\n",
    "- **Page 2** has the lowest rank (0.166), indicating it has fewer or less important incoming links.\n",
    "- **Page 4** has a rank of 0.179, indicating moderate importance.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Theory Behind PageRank Algorithm**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Concept of Random Surfer Model**\n",
    "- PageRank is based on the **Random Surfer Model**, where a user randomly clicks links on web pages.\n",
    "- There is a **damping factor** (usually 0.85) which models the probability that the user will follow a link. The remaining probability (1 - damping factor) represents the chance that the user will jump to a random page instead of following a link.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Stochastic Matrix**\n",
    "- The adjacency matrix is normalized into a **stochastic matrix**, where each column represents the probability distribution over outgoing links from a page.\n",
    "  \n",
    "#### **Convergence**\n",
    "- The PageRank values converge when the difference between the previous and current values is less than a given tolerance (`tol`). This ensures that the ranks stabilize and that the algorithm stops after a fixed number of iterations or when it converges.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Summary**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **PageRank** is a graph-based algorithm used to rank the importance of web pages based on their link structure.\n",
    "- The algorithm is iterative and calculates the rank of each page using a combination of its link-following probability and a teleportation factor.\n",
    "- The final PageRank values reflect the relative importance of each page in the network.\n",
